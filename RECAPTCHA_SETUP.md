# Google reCAPTCHA Setup Guide

## Overview
Google reCAPTCHA has been successfully integrated into your contact form. To complete the setup, you need to obtain API keys from Google and configure environment variables.

## Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Get Google reCAPTCHA Keys
1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)
2. Click "Create" to add a new site
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Label**: Your site name (e.g., "dcblack.co.uk Contact Form")
   - **reCAPTCHA type**: Choose "reCAPTCHA v2" ‚Üí "I'm not a robot" checkbox
   - **Domains**: Add your domain(s):
     - `dcblack.co.uk`
     - `www.dcblack.co.uk`
     - `localhost` (for development)
     - `127.0.0.1` (for development)
4. Accept the Terms of Service
5. Click "Submit"

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables to your system or `.env` file:

```bash
# Google reCAPTCHA Configuration
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_site_key_here
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Important**: 
- The **Site Key** goes in `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`
- The **Secret Key** goes in `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`

### 3. For Development
If you're using a `.env` file for development, create one in your project root:

```bash
# .env file
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=6LcXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=6LcXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### 4. For Production
Set these environment variables on your production server:
- Through your hosting provider's control panel
- Or via command line: `export RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_key_here`

## What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Code Changes Made:
1. **Dependencies**: Updated requirements.txt with proper Flask-WTF dependency
2. **Configuration**: Added reCAPTCHA config settings to `app/config.py`
3. **Form**: Added reCAPTCHA field to `ContactForm` in `app/forms.py`
4. **Template**: Added reCAPTCHA widget to contact form in `app/templates/main/contact.html`
5. **Styling**: Added terminal-themed CSS for reCAPTCHA in `app/static/src/style.css`
6. **Validation**: Automatic validation through existing form handling

### üîß Features:
- **Security**: Protects against spam and bot submissions
- **User Experience**: Clean integration with terminal theme
- **Error Handling**: Shows validation errors if reCAPTCHA fails
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

## Testing

### Before Going Live:
1. Set up reCAPTCHA keys as described above
2. Test the contact form locally

4. Test form submission with and without completing reCAPTCHA
5. Check that validation errors display properly

### Troubleshooting:
- **reCAPTCHA not appearing**: Check that `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` is set correctly
- **Validation always fails**: Verify `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY` is correct
- **Domain errors**: Ensure your domain is added to the reCAPTCHA site configuration

## Security Notes
- Never commit your secret key to version control
- Use different keys for development and production if needed
- Regularly monitor your reCAPTCHA admin console for suspicious activity
